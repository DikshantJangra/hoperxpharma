# Data Backup Policy

**Cloud Backup:**
- HopeRx performs automated daily backups to secure cloud servers (AWS/GCP).
- Data is replicated across multiple zones for disaster recovery.

**Local Backup (Hybrid Mode):**
- If using Offline POS, data syncs to cloud when internet returns.
- You can manually "Export Data" from Settings → Data Management for your own archives.
