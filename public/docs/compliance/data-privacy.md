# Data Privacy & GDPR/DPDP

**Patient Consent:**
- When adding a customer, ask for consent to store medical history and send SMS.
- Toggle `Marketing Consent` checkbox in profile.

**Right to be Forgotten:**
- If a customer requests deletion:
- Go to Customer Profile → Privacy → Anonymize Data.
- Personal details (Name, Phone) are wiped; transaction data remains for tax purposes (linked to "Anonymous").

**Data Encryption:**
- All patient data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
