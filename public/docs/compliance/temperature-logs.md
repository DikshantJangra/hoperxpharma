# Temperature & Fridge Logs

**Best Practice:**
- Record temperature twice daily (Morning/Evening).
- Range: 2°C to 8°C for most vaccines/insulins.

**Digital Log:**
- Compliance → Temperature Log → Add Entry.
- If using IoT sensors (integrated), this is auto-filled.
- Alert triggers if temp goes out of range.
