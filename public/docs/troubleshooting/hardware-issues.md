# Hardware Connection Issues

**Printer not printing:**
- Check if paper roll is empty or lid is open.
- Verify USB cable / IP address.
- Test print from OS settings (Windows/Mac).

**Scanner not scanning:**
- Ensure it's in "Keyboard Mode" (HID).
- If scanning on mobile/tablet, ensure OTG cable is working.
- Scan "Factory Reset" barcode from scanner manual if configuration is messed up.
