# Sales by Category

**Pie Chart View:**
- Visualizes revenue split.
- e.g., 60% Medicines, 30% FMCG, 10% Surgical.

**Strategic Decisions:**
- If FMCG sales are growing, consider expanding shelf space for shampoos/soaps.
- If Surgical sales are dropping, check if a nearby hospital changed suppliers.
