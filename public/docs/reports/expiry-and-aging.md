# Expiry & Aging Analysis

**Expiry Report:**
- Lists batches expiring in next 30/60/90 days.
- Action: Return to supplier or discount.

**Stock Aging (Non-moving):**
- Identifies items sitting on shelf > 180 days.
- Action: Liquidation or stop reordering.

Best practice:
- Review Expiry Report weekly (Monday mornings).
- Review Aging Report monthly.
