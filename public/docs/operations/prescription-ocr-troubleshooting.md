# OCR Troubleshooting & Accuracy Improvement

Common problems:
- Blurry image → ask for a retake.
- Handwriting not clear → manually type the medicine.
- Wrong split between dosage and medicines → correct on review screen.

Tips to improve:
1. Use native camera mode (high-res).
2. Ensure consistent lighting and flat paper.
3. Train staff to take clear overhead images (no angle).

If OCR fails repeatedly for a doctor’s handwriting, add a custom mapping or pre-define frequently used medicines for that clinic.
