# Barcode Labeling Best Practices

- **Manufacturer Barcodes:** Use these whenever possible (EAN-13).
- **Internal Barcodes:** Use for loose items or strips cut from boxes.
- **Shelf Labels:** Print "Shelf Tags" with barcode + price for items that are too small to label individually.

Format:
- Code 128 is recommended for internal labels (compact and reliable).
