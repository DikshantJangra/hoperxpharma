# Reorder Points & Safety Stock

Quick Steps
1. Inventory → Products → Select product → Settings tab.
2. Set `Reorder Point`, `Safety Stock`, and `Lead Time (days)`.
3. Save.

Explanation:
- **Reorder Point**: Stock level that triggers reorder.
- **Safety Stock**: Buffer to avoid stockouts during lead time.
- **Lead Time**: Typical days between ordering and receiving.

Tip: If you use AI Forecast, keep reorder points loose and let AI suggest optimal quantities; use manual reorder points for critical drugs.
