# Physical Stock Take (Auditing)

Best Practice: Perform full audit annually, and "cycle counts" (random shelf checks) weekly.

Workflow:
1. Inventory → Stock Take → Start New.
2. Print "Blind Count Sheet" (lists items without showing system qty).
3. Staff counts items and enters data into system (or scans via mobile app).
4. System highlights discrepancies (Variance Report).
5. Manager approves variance to update system stock.
