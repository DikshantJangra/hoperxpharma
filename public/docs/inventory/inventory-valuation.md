# Inventory Valuation Methods

HopeRx supports two methods (configure in Settings → Finance):

1. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):**
   - Assumes first purchased batch is sold first.
   - Value = Cost of most recent batches.
   - Best for perishable goods (medicines).

2. **Weighted Average:**
   - Value = Total Cost / Total Qty.
   - Smoothes out price fluctuations.

Report: Reports → Financials → Stock Valuation.
