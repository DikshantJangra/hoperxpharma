# Supplier Performance & Ratings

The system automatically rates suppliers (1-5 stars) based on:
- **Fill Rate:** Did they deliver 100% of ordered items?
- **Timeliness:** Did they deliver within the promised lead time?
- **Price Variance:** Did invoice price match PO price?

Viewing ratings:
- Suppliers → Performance Dashboard.
- Use this data to negotiate better terms or switch vendors for critical items.
